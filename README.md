# GameOfChess

We implement a 7 by 7 Chess board with 14 pieces: one King, one Queen, one Rook, one Bishop, one Knight, one Empress, one Princess, two Ferz and five Pawns

We play from the White player's side and try to win/draw maximum games

Implementing alpha-beta pruning search, we ensure only best move is returned to ensure we win/draw against the opponent
